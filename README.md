In this notebbok, I go through pruning a classical neural network model to reduce both model size and latency. The goals are:

- Understand the basic concept of **pruning**
- Implement and apply **fine-grained pruning**
- Implement and apply **channel pruning**
- Get a basic understanding of performance improvement (such as speedup) from pruning.
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these pruning approaches.
